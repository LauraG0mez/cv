	abstract = {LiNixMnyCo1 − x − yO2 compounds (NMC) are layered oxides widely used in commercial lithium-ion batteries at the positive electrode. Nevertheless surface reactivity of this material is still not well known. As a first step, based on first principle calculations, this study deals with the electronic properties and the surface reactivity of LiMO2 (M = Co, Ni, Mn) compounds, considering the behavior of each transition metal separately in the same R 3 ̅ m α-NaFeO2-type structure, the one of LiCoO2 and NMC. For each compound, after a brief description of the bare slab electronic properties, we explored the acido-basic and redox properties of the (110) and (104) surfaces by considering the adsorption of a gaseous probe. The chemisorption of SO2 produces both sulfite or sulfate species associated respectively to an acido-basic or a reduction process. These processes are localized on the transition metals of the first two layers of the surface. Although sulfate species are globally favored, a different behavior is obtained depending on both the surface and the transition metal considered. We conclude with a simple scheme which describes the reduction processes on the both surfaces in terms of formal oxidation degrees of transition metals.},

	abstract = {LixPOyNz is an amorphous solid electrolyte widely used in microbattery devices. The present study, based on a confrontation between experiment and theory, aims at providing new knowledge regarding the ionic conductivity model of such systems in correlation with its structure. The computational strategy involved molecular dynamic simulations and first-principle calculations on molecular and periodic models. The experimental target data involve electronic and vibrational properties and were considered through the simulation of Raman and X-ray photoemission spectra in order to identify characteristic patterns of LixPOyNz. In particular, the presence of short phosphate chains is suggested by molecular dynamics calculations, and the simulation of Raman spectra clearly evidenced a new coordination for nitrogen atoms in the amorphous state, not considered until now in the experimental structural model of the electrolyte and initially hypothesized based on core level binding energy computations. Monovalent nitrogen atoms together with short phosphate chains were used to build a structural model of the electrolyte and appeared to lead to a better reproduction of the target experimental results, while it implies a necessary refinement of the diffusion schemes commonly considered for lithium ions.},

As a starting point, Li2PO2N models were investigated. These models, proposed by Du et al. on the basis of thermodynamics and vibrational properties, were the first structural models of Li x PO y N z .

	abstract = {The present article presents a theoretical study of the dynamics of the chromophore of the Green Fluorescent Protein in its excited state on a long time scale (a few ten nanoseconds) in order to help the interpretation of time resolved experiments. The starting hypothesis is that the quenching of fluorescence is related to the internal motion of the chromophore, usually called ‘ φ torsion’. In fact, that motion is hindered by the protein and cannot be studied by standard molecular dynamics. Therefore we have developed a different approach involving three steps.

First the potential of mean force {(PMF)} along the considered torsion is obtained by biased molecular dynamics (umbrella sampling). Then, a long time scale, single particle Brownian dynamics is performed using that {PMF} and an appropriate diffusion constant. Finally we determine the nth passage time {(NPT)} distribution functions at geometries or regions where nonradiative ground state recovery may occur. The {NPT} distributions generalize the more usual ’mean first passage time’ and allow determining different quantities like fluorescence decay profiles, mean fluorescence lifetime, quantum yield etc.

These quantities are used here in a qualitative discussion of the fluorescence decay in Green Fluorescent Protein.},
