Li2MnO3 is considered as a model compound suitable to go further in the understanding of the role of tetravalent manganese atoms in the surface reactivity of layered lithium oxides. The knowledge of the surface properties of such materials is essential to understand the mechanisms involved in parasitic phenomena responsible for early aging or poor storage performances of lithium-ion batteries. The surface reactivity was probed through the adsorption of SO2 gas molecules on large Li2MnO3 crystals to be able to focus the XPS beam on the top of the (001) surface. A chemical mapping and XPS characterization of the material before and after SO2 adsorption show in particular that the adsorption is homogeneous at the micro- and nanoscale and involves Mn reduction, whereas first-principles calculations on a slab model of the surface allow us to conclude that the most energetically favorable species formed is a sulfate with charge transfer implying reduction of Mn.},

LiMn2O4 compounds are good candidates as positive electrode of high-power lithium-ion batteries for portable devices. The samples were investigated using both experimental and theoretical approaches. On the experimental point of view, they were characterized in depth from X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses. Then, the reactivity was investigated through the adsorption of (SO2) gaseous probes, in controlled conditions, followed by XPS characterization. First-principle calculations were conducted simultaneously to investigate the electronic properties and the reactivity of relevant surfaces of an ideal LiMn2O4 material. The results allow us to conclude that the reactivity of the samples is dominated by an acido-basic reactivity and the formation of sulfite species. Nonetheless, on the x = 0.05 sample, both sulfite and sulfate species are obtained, the later, in lesser extent, corresponding to a redox reactivity. Combining experimental and theoretical results, this redox reactivity could be associated with the presence of a larger quantity of Mn4+ cations on the last surface layers of the material linked to a specific surface orientation.},

These phases have a high tendency to aggregate, mainly as a result of the presence of asphaltenes, the composition of which has been fairly unclear up to now. The chemical composition of this phase is one of the driving forces behind the physical–chemical behavior in oil, and the structure–property relations of these systems are key in the development of improved refining techniques, including the design of new catalysts. In this paper, the aggregation of asphaltene molecules is studied with regard to molecular architecture and variations in the size of the aromatic core and lateral chain length using classical molecular dynamics simulations. How these characteristics are impacted by the temperature and pressure is also examined. This analysis provides a general overview of the factors that have the strongest impact on the formation and stability of nanoaggregates and clusters of nanoaggregates.},

Nevertheless surface reactivity of this material is still not well known.

For each compound, after a brief description of the bare slab electronic properties, we explored the acido-basic and redox properties of the (110) and (104) surfaces by considering the adsorption of a gaseous probe. The chemisorption of SO2 produces both sulfite or sulfate species associated respectively to an acido-basic or a reduction process. These processes are localized on the transition metals of the first two layers of the surface. Although sulfate species are globally favored, a different behavior is obtained depending on both the surface and the transition metal considered. We conclude with a simple scheme which describes the reduction processes on the both surfaces in terms of formal oxidation degrees of transition metals.},

The present study, based on a confrontation between experiment and theory, aims at providing new knowledge regarding the ionic conductivity model of such systems in correlation with its structure. The computational strategy involved molecular dynamic simulations and first-principle calculations on molecular and periodic models. The experimental target data involve electronic and vibrational properties and were considered through the simulation of Raman and X-ray photoemission spectra in order to identify characteristic patterns of LixPOyNz. In particular, the presence of short phosphate chains is suggested by molecular dynamics calculations, and the simulation of Raman spectra clearly evidenced a new coordination for nitrogen atoms in the amorphous state, not considered until now in the experimental structural model of the electrolyte and initially hypothesized based on core level binding energy computations. Monovalent nitrogen atoms together with short phosphate chains were used to build a structural model of the electrolyte and appeared to lead to a better reproduction of the target experimental results, while it implies a necessary refinement of the diffusion schemes commonly considered for lithium ions.},

The starting hypothesis is that the quenching of fluorescence is related to the internal motion of the chromophore, usually called ‘ φ torsion’. In fact, that motion is hindered by the protein and cannot be studied by standard molecular dynamics. Therefore we have developed a different approach involving three steps.

First the potential of mean force {(PMF)} along the considered torsion is obtained by biased molecular dynamics (umbrella sampling). Then, a long time scale, single particle Brownian dynamics is performed using that {PMF} and an appropriate diffusion constant. Finally we determine the nth passage time {(NPT)} distribution functions at geometries or regions where nonradiative ground state recovery may occur. The {NPT} distributions generalize the more usual ’mean first passage time’ and allow determining different quantities like fluorescence decay profiles, mean fluorescence lifetime, quantum yield etc.

These quantities are used here in a qualitative discussion of the fluorescence decay in Green Fluorescent Protein.},

	abstract = {The dynamics and electronic absorption spectrum of enhanced cyan fluorescent protein {(ECFP)}, a mutant of green fluorescent protein {(GFP)}, have been studied by means of a 1 ns molecular dynamics {(MD)} simulation. The two X-ray conformations A? and B? of {ECFP} were considered. The chromophore was assumed to be neutral, and all titratable residues were taken in their standard protonation state at neutral {pH.} The protein was embedded in a box of water molecules (and counterions). The first result is that the two conformations A? and B? are found to be stable all along the simulation. Then, an analysis of the hydrogen-bond networks shows strong differences between the two conformations in the surroundings of the nitrogen atom of the indolic part of the chromophore. This is partly due to the imperfection in the ? barrel near the His148 residue, which allows the access of one solvent molecule inside the protein in conformation A?. Finally, quantum mechanical calculations of the electronic transition energies of the chromophore in the charge cloud of the protein and solvent water molecules were performed using the {TDDFT} method on 160 snapshots extracted every 5 ps of the {MD} trajectories. It is found that conformations A? and B? exhibit very similar spectra despite different H-bond networks involving the chromophore. This similarity is related to the weak charge transfer involved in the electronic transition and the weak electrostatic field created by {ECFP} near the chromophore, within the hypotheses made in the present simulation.
