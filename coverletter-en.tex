%\lettersection{Introduction}

Passionate and with an analytical mindset, I love finding solutions to help people stay healthy and improve their daily lives.
That is why I chose to further my mechatronics engineering studies with a biomedical specialization. 

During my research Master's in biomedical engineering, I had the opportunity to do an intership with a group consisting of dentists and researchers (INSERM Centre de recherche des Cordeliers, Paris). 
Their subject of research was the impact of a muscle segment homeobox gene on dental development. 
This experience introduced me to what turned out to be a fascinating subject, namely biomedical engineering for dental applications. I continued my professional experience in the medical field by working for Air Liquide Medical Systems on respiratory devices as a project manager and mechanics specialist, 
and I can say that my experience aligns perfectly with the qualifications you are seeking at FKG Dentaire S.A.
That is why I am certain I would make a valuable addition to your organisation.

In fact, during my career, I had some great experiences as a technical project leader. 
Following the product from the customer's requirements to its delivery and working closely with all the internal and external stakeholders.
In particular, I can take as an example my experience at Zodiac's as a technical project manager. 
I was the technical reference for our Italian client and my role was to translate the client's requirements into technical specification, with accordance with the different R\&D Managers (Mechanical, Electronical and Software team leaders).
I established with the team leaders the different deadlines and set the priorities to be able to fit to the client's planning as well as to the R\&D team's.
In addition to the organizational part, I asked to perform tests when derisking was necessary, and I conceved harness to fit to the client's need (regarding to the electronical parts to control, to the lenghts needed and to the path it would take through the airplane seats).
When the first system was complet, I went to test it with a software engineer at the client's place to validate the result.

Highly adaptable, methodical and proactive, you will be able to count on me to support the R\&D and Project Managers as well as the Sales Team
to lead the project to succes while also to capitalize the knowledge by keeping the documentation up to date.
