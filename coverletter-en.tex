%\lettersection{Introduction}

Passionate and with an analytical mindset, I love finding solutions to help other people stay healthy and improve their daily lives.
That is why I chose to further my mechatronics engineering studies with a biomedical specialty. 

During my research Master's in biomedical engineering, I had the opportunity to do an intership with dentists (INSERM Centre de recherche des Cordeliers,). 
Their subject of research was the impact of a muscle segment homeobox gene on dental development. 
This experience introduced me to what turned out to be a fascinating subject, namely biomedical engineering on dental application. 
I continued my professional experience in the medical field by working for Air Liquide Medical Systems on respiratory devices as a project manager and mechanics specialist, 
and I can say that my experience aligns perfectly with the qualifications you are seeking at FKG Dentaire S.A.
That is why I am certain I would make a valuable addition to your organisation.

In fact, during my career, I had some great experiences as a technical project leader. 
Following the product from the customer's requirements to its delivery and working closely with all the internal and external stakeholders.

Highly adaptable, methodical and proactive, you will be able to count on me to support the R\&D and Project Managers as well as the Sales Team
to lead the project to succes while also to capitalize the knowledge by keeping the documentation up to date.
