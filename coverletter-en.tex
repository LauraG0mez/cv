%\lettersection{Introduction}

Passionate, curious and with an analytical mindset, I love finding solutions to help people stay healthy and improve their daily lives;
and it is this passion which has guided me in my choice of studies. Firstly, with a master's degree in mechatronic engineering and then by studying a second master's in biomechanical engineering. 

I like to work in the medical field and with innovative teams. With your expertise and beliefs, I'm sure I've found a great company to work for.
%What attracts me to Johnson \& Johnson is the great number of solutions you develop to Keep People Moving. From skull implants to foot screws, you innovate in the orthopedic domain to improve the lives of people.
%
But it was mainly during my mission at Zodiac that I had the chance to manage a team for the technical aspect of the project.
My position allowed me to have a global vision of the project and I therefore knew for each problem that disrupted the planning and the project, what would have an impact and consequences on the rest of the project.
I then tried to understand the reasons and then I listened to the solutions proposed by the people concerned and their arguments.
Once I knew all the ins and outs, I could redirect the tasks by explaining all the decisions and warn the people at the end of the chain of future impacts.

The human aspects which seemed essential to me are the clear communication on the objectives, the targeted performances as well as the individual expectations while promoting cooperation.

Very adaptable, methodical and proactive, you can count on me to carry out projects in an environment with transversal professions and a multicultural context.

Motivated to be part of an international and innovative team, I would like to join Sonceboz and continue to learn while winning to deliver impactful products, to patients around the world.

I would be thrilled to learn more about this job opening. Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you.

% What attracts me to X is the sheer number of solutions you develop to keep people moving. From cranial implants to foot screws, you are breaking new ground in orthopedics to improve people's lives.
