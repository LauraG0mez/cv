The new helical propensity modification is tested using the benchmark proteins hen egg-white lysozyme, fox1 RNA binding domain, chorismate mutase and the GCN4-p1 peptide. The stability of the proteins is improved in comparison with the 53A6 force field, and good agreement with a range of primary experimental data is obtained.},

These molecules were mixed together with different relative concentrations, and for the first time, the aggregation of different asphaltenes was determined using molecular dynamics simulations (MDS). The results show that the interaction energies vary for different heteroatom arrangement within a given structure and depend on the type of asphaltene. Moreover, we showed that the chain-ends have a crucial role on this phenomenon.},

Nevertheless surface reactivity of this material is still not well known. As a first step, based on first principle calculations, this study deals with the electronic properties and the surface reactivity of LiMO2 (M = Co, Ni, Mn) compounds, considering the behavior of each transition metal separately in the same R 3 ̅ m α-NaFeO2-type structure, the one of LiCoO2 and NMC. For each compound, after a brief description of the bare slab electronic properties, we explored the acido-basic and redox properties of the (110) and (104) surfaces by considering the adsorption of a gaseous probe. The chemisorption of SO2 produces both sulfite or sulfate species associated respectively to an acido-basic or a reduction process. These processes are localized on the transition metals of the first two layers of the surface. Although sulfate species are globally favored, a different behavior is obtained depending on both the surface and the transition metal considered. We conclude with a simple scheme which describes the reduction processes on the both surfaces in terms of formal oxidation degrees of transition metals.},

The present study, based on a confrontation between experiment and theory, aims at providing new knowledge regarding the ionic conductivity model of such systems in correlation with its structure. The computational strategy involved molecular dynamic simulations and first-principle calculations on molecular and periodic models. The experimental target data involve electronic and vibrational properties and were considered through the simulation of Raman and X-ray photoemission spectra in order to identify characteristic patterns of LixPOyNz. In particular, the presence of short phosphate chains is suggested by molecular dynamics calculations, and the simulation of Raman spectra clearly evidenced a new coordination for nitrogen atoms in the amorphous state, not considered until now in the experimental structural model of the electrolyte and initially hypothesized based on core level binding energy computations. Monovalent nitrogen atoms together with short phosphate chains were used to build a structural model of the electrolyte and appeared to lead to a better reproduction of the target experimental results, while it implies a necessary refinement of the diffusion schemes commonly considered for lithium ions.},

	abstract = {The present article presents a theoretical study of the dynamics of the chromophore of the Green Fluorescent Protein in its excited state on a long time scale (a few ten nanoseconds) in order to help the interpretation of time resolved experiments. The starting hypothesis is that the quenching of fluorescence is related to the internal motion of the chromophore, usually called ‘ φ torsion’. In fact, that motion is hindered by the protein and cannot be studied by standard molecular dynamics. Therefore we have developed a different approach involving three steps.

First the potential of mean force {(PMF)} along the considered torsion is obtained by biased molecular dynamics (umbrella sampling). Then, a long time scale, single particle Brownian dynamics is performed using that {PMF} and an appropriate diffusion constant. Finally we determine the nth passage time {(NPT)} distribution functions at geometries or regions where nonradiative ground state recovery may occur. The {NPT} distributions generalize the more usual ’mean first passage time’ and allow determining different quantities like fluorescence decay profiles, mean fluorescence lifetime, quantum yield etc.

These quantities are used here in a qualitative discussion of the fluorescence decay in Green Fluorescent Protein.},

The two X-ray conformations A? and B? of {ECFP} were considered. The chromophore was assumed to be neutral, and all titratable residues were taken in their standard protonation state at neutral {pH.} The protein was embedded in a box of water molecules (and counterions). The first result is that the two conformations A? and B? are found to be stable all along the simulation. Then, an analysis of the hydrogen-bond networks shows strong differences between the two conformations in the surroundings of the nitrogen atom of the indolic part of the chromophore. This is partly due to the imperfection in the ? barrel near the His148 residue, which allows the access of one solvent molecule inside the protein in conformation A?. Finally, quantum mechanical calculations of the electronic transition energies of the chromophore in the charge cloud of the protein and solvent water molecules were performed using the {TDDFT} method on 160 snapshots extracted every 5 ps of the {MD} trajectories. It is found that conformations A? and B? exhibit very similar spectra despite different H-bond networks involving the chromophore. This similarity is related to the weak charge transfer involved in the electronic transition and the weak electrostatic field created by {ECFP} near the chromophore, within the hypotheses made in the present simulation.
